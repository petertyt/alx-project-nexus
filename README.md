# Project Nexus – ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering

## 🧠 Overview of the Program

The ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program has equipped me with professional, real-world skills in building scalable, responsive, and maintainable web applications.

Throughout the program, I have worked on small to mid-sized projects, learned industry tools, and gained hands-on experience in frontend development.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies Learned

- **Mobile Development** (React Native with Expo)
- **Web Development** (React, Next.js)
- **PWA (Progressive Web Apps)** – Installable web experiences
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript
- **GraphQL** – Flexible data querying
- **API Integration** – Consuming external and internal APIs
- **System Design & Analysis** – Architecting scalable apps

## 🧩 Major Frontend Concepts Mastered

- Component-based UI development
- State Management (Redux, Context API)
- Routing and Navigation (React Router, Next.js)
- Responsive Design & Mobile-first thinking
- Code modularity and reusability

## 🚧 Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Building scalable UI with reusable components  
  **Solution:** Implemented atomic design principles and component composition.

- **Challenge:** State complexity in larger apps  
  **Solution:** Adopted Redux with toolkit and proper modular structure.

- **Challenge:** API errors and handling edge cases  
  **Solution:** Used error boundaries, fallback UIs, and improved data validation.

## 🌟 Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Use meaningful commit messages and frequent commits
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Prioritize accessibility and responsive design
- Leverage GitHub Projects or Trello for task tracking
- Collaborate early with backend developers

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project encourages strong collaboration between:

- **Frontend learners** (like myself) to exchange ideas and feedback
- **Backend learners** for API integration and real-time data handling

# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App – Project Nexus (ALX ProDev FE)

## 📌 Overview
The Movie Recommendation App is a user-focused application built as part of the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering capstone, **Project Nexus**. It allows users to explore trending movies and receive personalized recommendations, demonstrating a blend of real-world frontend development skills, performance optimization, and UI/UX design principles.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Dynamic Routing:** Use Next.js to create detailed pages for individual movies.
- **User Personalization:** Allow users to save favorite movies using local storage or an API.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Display trending and recommended movies in an engaging layout.

## 🔑 Key Features
1. **API Integration**
   - Fetch trending and recommended movies from a public movie API
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states during data fetching

2. **Dynamic Routing**
   - Use Next.js for server-side rendering and dynamic routes for movie detail pages
   - Ensure optimized navigation and fast loading

3. **Favorites Functionality**
   - Enable users to save favorite movies locally or via backend API
   - Display saved movies on a dedicated section of the dashboard

4. **Responsive and Interactive UI**
   - Design a fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Use smooth interactions (hover effects, animations) on movie cards

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Next.js / React Native** – For dynamic routing and app structure
- **TypeScript** – Enforcing type safety and maintainable code
- **Styled Components** – Building reusable, responsive UI components
- **Public Movie API** – Data source for movies
- **Vercel / Netlify** – For project hosting and deployment

## ⚙️ Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
feat: initialize Next.js project with TypeScript  
feat: integrate movie API for fetching data  
```

### Feature Development
```bash
feat: implement detailed movie pages with dynamic routing  
feat: add functionality to save favorite movies  
```

### UI Enhancements
```bash
style: design UI using Styled Components  
```

### Bug Fixes
```bash
fix: resolve rendering issues on dynamic pages  
```

### Documentation
```bash
docs: add API setup and usage instructions  
```

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality:** API data fetch, routing, favorites feature
- **Code Quality:** Clean, modular, and scalable with TypeScript
- **User Experience:** Smooth, responsive UI with intuitive interactions
- **Version Control:** Frequent and descriptive commits using Git best practices
